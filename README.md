# Halvat
A simple web page that retrieves real-time electricity  stock market data. The idea of the page is that there you can check what information the Shelly relay is searching for or has searched for. <br>
The application uses the same API interface as Shelly.

## NOTE!
You need to install the CORS plugin in your browser to see the data.<br>
(it's a server setting that I can't control.)

### Language

HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Usage:

Go to https://rutjake.github.io/halvat/ <br>
Install CORS plugin if you want to.
